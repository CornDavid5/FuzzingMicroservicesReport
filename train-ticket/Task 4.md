# Train Ticket Code Coverage
For `Train Ticket`:
- Most of the services is written in Java, and it uses `mockito` as mocking framework and `junit` as testing framework.
- Read through a few services, the tests did call all the functions in the source code, but there is a lot of if conditions in the source code, so without actually running any code coverage tools, it is hard to tell whether the coverage is high or not.
